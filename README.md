# F1 Track SVGs
This repository contains SVG files for all current Formula 1 tracks. The data is extraced from the Codemasters F1 games via UDP telemetry. The files were created for [F1Laps](https://www.f1laps.com). Since this was a lot of annoying work, we're happy to make them available to the public for free. 

The tracks vectors generally follow the tracks' racing lines. They are not a representation of the tracks' middle-of-the-road values. Each track also shows the individual sectors as additional layers. 

# F1 2020
You can find all files in the [f1_2020](f1_2020) folder and listed below.
